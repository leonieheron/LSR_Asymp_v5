In answer to your questions:   1.	Survey 1 was conducted from 21 to 29 February (weighted mean 26 February) and survey 2 was conducted on 7 March. Symptoms were re-assessed on 21 - 23 March 2020 (follow up) for all subjects showing no symptoms at the time of testing. We did not reassess symptoms at survey 2, only at follow up.   2.	The followed up time was hence 2 weeks for those identified at round 2 and 3 to 4 weeks for those identified at round 1.  3.	The definition of symptomatic used is: a subject who required hospitalization and/or reported fever (yes/no or a temperature above 37 degrees Celsius) and/or cough and/or at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, headache, diarrhoea, vomit, asthenia, muscle pain, joint pain, loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath. An asymptomatic infection is a PCR positive infection who does not show symptoms (as in the definition) at the time of testing nor at any time up to follow up (end of March). A pre-symptomatic infection is a PCR positive infection who does not show symptoms (as in the definition) at the time of testing but develops them afterwards, as assessed at follow up. It is possible in theory that someone classified as asymptomatic develops symptoms after follow up - in this case the infection would be pre-symptomatic but we would have misclassified it as asymptomatic. The minimum follow up time was 2 weeks, and given the current estimates on the incubation period this should have captured most pre-symptomatic infections.     I would be very interested in the systematic review that you are conducting, could you please share the results with me when they become available?     I hope this helps, please let me know if anything is unclear.     Best wishes,   Ilaria  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We read your two publications with interest and hope that we can include the data in our systematic review. We need to ask for some additional details about your study.    1.      In the publication with Susanne Brandstetter as first author (Pediatr Allergy Immunol 2020, Accepted 10 May), you included data from 31 participants with COVID-19.   a.      In Table 1, 30 had any symptom, so we assume that 1 had no symptoms. Is this correct?  b.      At the start of the results, you say that ""two individuals remained asymptomatic."" We assume that the study group is a subset of those from the earlier publication who agreed to take part in the serosurvey. Is this correct?  c.       How long after the outbreak was the serosurvey conducted?  2.      In the previous publication for which you were the first author (Pediatr Allergy Immunol 2020, Accepted 20 April), the total was 36 infected staff. In the discussion, you say ""At least 2 staff members who were tested positive remained asymptomatic for good.""   a.      Do you know the exact number that was asymptomatic and remained asymptomatic?`  b.      How long were the infected people followed up for?    We thank you in advance for helping us with these questions.    Kind regards,    Nicola Low       ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this, the proportion remaining asymptomatic is 46/126 (in the paper, reported 54/126 - so, more precisely, asymptomatic at the time of testing).    Can we change this please?

Juli 2020 22:14  To: Low, Nicola (ISPM) <nicola.low@ispm.unibe.ch>  Subject: Re: SARS-CoV-2 - I have seen your article!    Thanks for making me double check!  54/126 were asymptomatic at the time of testing  the first round of testing identified 49 residents who were positive and asymptomatic  the second round of testing identified 5 residents who subsequently tested positive and were asymptomatic at that time  8 out of the 54 asymptomatic residents developed symptoms, 46 remained asymptomatic  The 5 who tested positive in the second round had NO symptoms.   So it's fair to say that 8 had developed symptoms while 46 remained asymptomatic within the study period  (out of those 8 who became symptomatic - 5 had developed symptoms at the time of round 2 testing while 3 developed symptoms after that within the time frame of our study, however; as you point out the follow up is only a few days for some so I'm not sure it's worth going into that much detail, so ignore that split.)  It's fair to say that we should probably go through everyone of those 46 case notes to see if they remained asymptomatic after that, just not sure anyone has the bandwidth or time for this at the moment....  hope that makes sense now, really sorry for the muddle, I desperately need a break... we are off to venice and lake garda tomorrow for a couple of weeks. Will take my computer with me though so if you want more info might be able to help, brain permitting...  cxx    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
